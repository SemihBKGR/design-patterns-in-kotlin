# Singleton Design Pattern

|Name|Type|
|---|---|
|Singleton|Creational|

### In plain words

> Ensure that a class has only single instance and, provides a global access point to that instance

### Wikipedia says [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)

> In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern
> that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.
> This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
> The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.

## Explanation
The initialization of an object declaration is thread-safe and done on first access.
To refer to the object, use its name directly.

## Implementation

### Example:

```kotlin
object AppInfo {

    init {
        println("AppInfo singleton instance is being initialized")
    }

    val name: String = "Application"
    val version: String = "1.0.0"
    val os: String by lazy {
        println("Looking for OS")
        System.getProperty("os.name")
    }

    fun getAppTitle(): String = "$name: $version"

    fun instanceAddress(): String = Integer.toHexString(this.hashCode())

}
```

```kotlin
fun main() {
    
    println("AppTitle : ${AppInfo.getAppTitle()}")
    println("Singleton instance address: ${AppInfo.instanceAddress()}")
    println("Singleton instance address: ${AppInfo.instanceAddress()}")
    println("OS Name: ${AppInfo.os}")
    
}
```

```console
AppInfo singleton instance is being initialized
AppTitle : Application: 1.0.0
Singleton instance address: 783e6358
Singleton instance address: 783e6358
Looking for OS
OS Name: Windows 10
```
