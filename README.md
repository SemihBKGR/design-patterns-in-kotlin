# Design Patterns in Kotlin

Implementation of design patterns in Kotlin

## Types of Design Patterns

Design Patterns are mainly categorized into three section

* [Creational](#creational)
* [Structural](#structural)
* [Behavioral](#behavioral)

## Creational

> In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms,
> trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result
> in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow
> controlling this object creation.\

List of patterns

* Factory
* Singleton
* Builder

## Structural

> In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way
> to realize relationships among entities.\

List of patterns

* Adapter

## Behavioral

> In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns
> among objects. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication.\
