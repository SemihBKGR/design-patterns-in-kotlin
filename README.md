# Introduction

Design patterns implemented in Kotlin

# Types of Design Patterns

* [Creational](#creational-design-patterns)
* [Structural](#structural-design-patterns)
* [Behavioral](#behavioral-design-patterns)

## Creational Design Patterns

In plain words
> Creational patterns are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group of related objects.

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms,
> trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result
> in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow
> controlling this object creation.

## Structural Design Patterns

In plain words
> Structural patterns are mostly concerned with object composition or in other words how the entities can use each other.
> Or yet another explanation would be, they help in answering "How to build a software component?"

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple
> way to realize relationships between entities.

## Behavioral Design Patterns

In plain words
> It is concerned with assignment of responsibilities between the objects. What makes them different from structural
> patterns is they don't just specify the structure but also outline the patterns for message passing/communication
> between them. Or in other words, they assist in answering "How to run a behavior in software component?"

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns
> between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this
> communication.
