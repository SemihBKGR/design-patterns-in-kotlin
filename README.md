# Design Patterns in Kotlin

Implementation of GoF design patterns in Kotlin

## Types of Design Patterns

Design Patterns are mainly categorized into three sections

* [Creational](#creational)
* [Structural](#structural)
* [Behavioral](#behavioral)

## Creational

> In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.\

* Abstract Factory
* Prototype
* Builder
* Factory Method  
* Singleton

## Structural

> In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities.\

* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Proxy

## Behavioral

> In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication.\
